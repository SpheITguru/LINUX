### This is file 1 Note
In this book files, is me trying to organise my notes.

This is not a structured book, but for me to keep my notes organised.

Maybe later I will restructure, differently.

##### Some commands:
fg: to bring a command running in the background in the foreground

##### Linux shortcuts
1. Up Arrow key: This will display the most recent command from your shell history. 
2. Ctrl+A: This moves the cursor to the beginning of the command line.
3. etc 

#### Connecting and Expanding Commands
A truly powerful feature of the shell is the capability to redirect the input and output of commands to and from other commands and files.

##### Metacharacter
A metacharacter is a typed character that has special meaning to the shee for connecting commands or requesting expansion.

1. ( | ): pipe
2. ( & ): ampersand
3. ( ; ): semicolon
4. ( () ): left, right parenthesis
5. ( <> ): less, greater than sign
