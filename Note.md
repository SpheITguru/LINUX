## My Notes
### This is a digital rough book for my notes: Linux

The shell os a command language interpreter.

The default promt for a regular user is simply a dollar sign:
  $

The default prompt for the root user is a pound sign:
  \#

Note: You can also use sudo in order to run a command as a root user<<

### Choosing Your Shell
To find out your default login shell, enter the following commands:

$ whoami
$ grep siphephelo /etc/passwd
